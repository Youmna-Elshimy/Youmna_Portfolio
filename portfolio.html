            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    I am a recent Computer Science (Honours) graduate from the University of Wollongong, passionate about turning data into meaningful insight. With a 
                    strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and software development, I enjoy solving real-world problems through data-driven approaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My projects span from classifying social media misinformation using neural networks to building predictive models with Python and R. I have also 
                    explored areas like UI detection, customer profiling, and credit risk modeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently completing my Professional Year in IT at QIBA, I bring a mix of technical skill and soft strengths, such as communication, critical 
                    thinking, and leadership, developed through mentoring, volunteering, and hands-on experience.

                                    <h4>Assessing Generalisation Gaps in Image Classification</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        A big data analysis project comparing model performance across ImageNet and ImageNetV2. As project manager of a three-member 
                                        team, I coordinated roles, set deadlines, and facilitated meetings. This was my first time working with such a large dataset.
                                        The code took a significant amount of time to run due to its size, which taught me the importance of optimizing for scale. I 
                                        handled hyperparameter tuning, trained, tested, and evaluated the tuned model, created visualizations to compare performance 
                                        before and after tuning, and conducted KS hypothesis testing. I also documented and analysed the results.

                                        Led a six-member team, assigning roles, setting deadlines, and facilitating weekly meetings to ensure steady progress. I 
                                        specifically chose to take on text processing, as it was an area I hadn’t worked with before and I wanted to challenge myself. 
                                        I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis, and applied TF-IDF and sentiment analysis to uncover 
                                        linguistic and emotional patterns. I then visualized the results to highlight differences between human and non-human profiles.
