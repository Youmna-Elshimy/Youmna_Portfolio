            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    I was often told I was too curious, but that same curiosity is the foundation of my career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hello! I’m a Computer Science (Honours) graduate with a passion for solving problems through data analysis 
                    or helping users troubleshoot tech issues. I enjoy exploring how systems work, asking the right questions, 
                    and turning complexity into practical, meaningful solutions.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Over the course of my studies, I have built neural networks, classified social media profiles, benchmarked 
                    image recognition models, and explored how data can support better business decisions. But I have also 
                    worked in roles that required clear communication, empathy, and real-time problem-solving like volunteering 
                    as a Technology Assistant or supporting users during large-scale public events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What really sets me apart is my analytical thinking and people-centered support. I love tackling challenges, 
                    finding stories behind numbers, and resolving a technical issue for someone who is stuck. For this mindset, 
                    UOW Pulse referred to me as “brilliant and driven” with “a knack for problem-solving like no other,” and 
                    appreciated how my innovative ideas kept things running smoothly, along with my natural leadership. They 
                    also awarded me the Volunteer of the Month award and the Innovation & Community Award in appreciation for 
                    my problem-solving skills that improved their pantry processes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically, I bring a strong toolkit: Python, R, C++, Java, SQL, Tableau, MongoDB, and cloud tools like 
                    AWS. I am also comfortable using the command line, managing version control, and working with backend 
                    frameworks like Spring Boot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently looking to start my career in IT support where I can continue learning. However, I have a 
                    long-term goal of bridging tech support and data analysis to make smarter, more informed decisions in any 
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to reach out anytime as I am always open to learning, collaborating, or helping solve the next 
                    problem!
                </p>

                                    <h4>Bear Hunt Strategy Optimization – Whiteout Survival</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This ongoing project aims to optimize performance in the Bear Hunt event from the mobile game Whiteout Survival. Since the game 
                                        does not offer a public API, I am currently in the data collection stage, manually logging rallies, troop deployments, and 
                                        milestone progress. The project focuses on identifying which rally types offer the best reward-to-effort ratio, developing a 
                                        strategy to assign troops across seven deployments for maximum damage, and predicting when all milestones will be achieved. I 
                                        also plan to build a performance dashboard to visualize damage by deployment, rally effectiveness, and milestone progress over 
                                        time. Additionally, I will explore damage forecasting using time series or regression models to support more strategic 
                                        decision-making during the event.

                                    <h4>Text Classification Using Neural Networks</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        In this project, I built a neural network model to automatically sort BBC news articles into six 
                                        topics. I started by cleaning and preparing the textual data by removing common stopwords, 
                                        tokenizing the text, and ensuring each article was the same length. I then converted the text into 
                                        sequences that the model could understand. The model used embedding layers to help it understand 
                                        the relationships between words and dense layers to classify the articles into their topics. After 
                                        training for 30 epochs, it reached about 95% accuracy on unseen articles. I tracked its progress 
                                        with performance visualizations. This project enhanced my understanding of natural 
                                        language processing and gave me valuable experience working with real-world text data and the 
                                        challenges that come with it.

                                    <p>
                                        A big data analysis project comparing model performance across ImageNet and ImageNetV2. As project manager of a three-member 
                                        team, I coordinated roles, set deadlines, and facilitated meetings. This was my first time working with such a large dataset.
                                        The code took a significant amount of time to run due to its size, which taught me the importance of optimizing for scale. I 
                                        handled hyperparameter tuning, trained, tested, and evaluated the tuned model, created visualizations to compare performance 
                                        before and after tuning, and conducted KS hypothesis testing. I also documented and analysed the results.

                                        I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis, and applied TF-IDF and sentiment analysis to uncover 
                                        linguistic and emotional patterns. I then visualized, documented, and analyzed the results to highlight differences between human

                                        handled data preprocessing, EDA, and developed a Random Forest classifier to train, test, and evaluate the model. I also 
                                        documented the workflow and thoroughly analyzed the results to extract key insights. This project was a valuable leadership 
                                        experience, as it was my first time managing a large team with members balancing both academic and work commitments. Navigating 
                                        those challenges helped me grow in coordination, communication, and time management.

                                    <p>
                                        This was my very first data analysis group project and also my first time learning R. I chose to take this subject and take on the 
                                        challenge knowing I would be working with students who already had experience in both areas. I had to learn quickly, and while it 
                                        was challenging at times, it pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow. In our team of four, I took the lead on data 
                                        preprocessing, EDA, and visualizations. I also built and evaluated a Random Forest model, and documented our findings in a final 
                                        presentation. The project was a rewarding learning experience that strengthened both my technical and collaborative skills. It 
                                        was also what made me interested in data analysis.

                                    <p>
                                        I worked on this project alongside the “Bank Marketing – Term Deposit Prediction” task. The goal was to predict customer 
                                        creditworthiness using 46 financial and demographic attributes. After exploring the dataset through statistical analysis and SOMs, 
                                        I implemented and compared several models including MLP, Decision Tree, Random Forest (manual tuning), SVM (auto-tuning), Naive 
                                        Bayes, and Logistic Regression. I applied feature selection, evaluated models using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and ROC 
                                        curves, and predicted the credit rating of a median customer. This project strengthened my skills in R and machine learning, 
                                        especially in handling imbalanced, real-world data.

                                        This was my first time using RapidMiner, and I worked as part of a four-member team to analyze a supermarket chain's data. I was 
                                        initially responsible for building some of the K-means clustering models, but due to a teammate’s unexpected situation, I took on 
                                        the full responsibility of developing all clustering models. These included customer segmentation, product popularity analysis, 
                                        and geographic purchase behavior. I also documented and interpreted the results of my models, highlighting insights and future 
                                        strategies that could support loyalty programs and sales strategies. This project helped me quickly adapt to a new tool while 
                                        learning how to take ownership and communicate data-driven findings clearly.

                                    <p>
                                        This is a personal project in which I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to 
                                        analyze global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by country and over time. The goal was to 
                                        present complex environmental data in a clear, engaging format that allows users to 
                                        explore emission trends and make meaningful comparisons between countries. The 
                                        dashboard includes features such as: global and historical trends in CO₂ emissions, 
                                        country-level breakdowns with interactive visual filters, and per capita emissions to 
                                        provide population-adjusted insights. Throughout this project, I applied key data 
                                        visualization principles, focused on usability, and refined my ability to translate raw 
                                        data into an informative user experience. It also strengthened my skills in working 
                                        with real-world datasets and creating dashboards that communicate insights effectively.

                                        This is a personal Tableau project in which I analyzed global CO₂ emissions per capita 
                                        using data from four different sources, which I combined using an inner join to ensure 
                                        consistent country-year matching. The dashboard presents visual insights into how 
                                        emissions per person have evolved over time across different countries and regions. 
                                        Users can explore patterns, compare countries, and identify trends in environmental 
                                        impact from a per capita perspective. This project improved my ability to clean and 
                                        merge datasets, apply relational joins, and design time-based visualizations for 
                                        comparative analysis.

                                        This is a personal project in which I developed a Tableau dashboard that analyzes data 
                                        from the World Happiness Report, with a focus on visualizing the relationships between 
                                        happiness scores and key contributing factors such as economy, family, health, and 
                                        generosity. The project includes a series of scatter plots and tables across multiple 
                                        views, allowing users to explore how different factors correlate with happiness across 
                                        countries. The dashboard is divided into sections each exploring one specific factor. 
                                        It also contains summary dashboards that offer broader comparisons. This project 
                                        enhanced my ability to design targeted visual analyses, use interactive dashboards 
                                        effectively, and present multi-faceted global data in a clear and organized way.

                                    <p>
                                        This project was one of the largest and most detailed I have worked on, involving the creation of a realistic election campaign 
                                        simulator in C++. The simulator models political parties, candidates, leaders, and electorates, each holding unique stances on 
                                        key national issues. Each simulated campaign day, random events, such as candidate debates, affected voter opinions, shifting the 
                                        party popularity. To determine election outcomes, the program considered candidates' characteristics, voter demographics, and 
                                        party positions on major issues. Developing this project involved managing over 20 interconnected files and designing an extensive 
                                        class hierarchy, greatly enhancing my skills in object-oriented design, event-driven logic, and complex system architecture.

                                    <p>
                                        This was a hands-on project where I built a Java-based system to simulate ordering custom PC parts. The program allows users to 
                                        select compatible components, such as CPUs, motherboards, memory, and graphics cards, while handling brand-specific rules for 
                                        Intel and AMD. It also supports both member and non-member customers, with automatic discount application. I structured the system 
                                        using object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism to keep the design clean and modular. This project helped me 
                                        deepen my understanding of OOP and apply it to a realistic, logic-driven ordering scenario.

                                        This was one of the first large-scale projects where I applied object-oriented programming to build a full student management 
                                        system in Java. It models real-world academic processes like course enrollment, tracking student records, and managing both 
                                        undergraduate and postgraduate students. I designed and connected multiple classes, such as Student, Subject, Course, and 
                                        Enrollment, to reflect how an actual university system might work. Working on this project really helped me understand how to 
                                        structure code clearly and design systems that are easy to extend and maintain.

                                        In this Java project, I built a simulation that models how customers interact with bank tellers, helping to understand queue 
                                        dynamics and service efficiency. Using object-oriented programming, I created classes to represent customers and tellers, and 
                                        implemented a priority queue to manage service order realistically. Customer data, including arrival and service times, was 
                                        loaded from a file, making the simulation reflect real-life situations. This project gave me practical experience with managing 
                                        data structures, writing event-driven logic, and designing clear, organized code to tackle everyday problems.

                                        In this project, I built a Java application that calculates optimal paths through a weighted graph, reading data directly from 
                                        structured text files. I developed a custom min-heap structure for efficient pathfinding and designed classes like Vertex and 
                                        Path to represent the graph clearly and effectively. This work deepened my understanding of data structures, algorithm 
                                        optimization, and practical application of graph theory to solve realistic routing problems.

                                        These two small web projects gave me a chance to practice working with JSON data and making dynamic web pages using AJAX. One 
                                        project loads and displays university faculty details, while the other lets users search for airports and view related 
                                        information instantly without reloading the page. Building them helped me get more comfortable with asynchronous JavaScript, 
                                        working with external data, and updating the page content through the DOM.

                                    <p>
                                        In this project, I worked with XML and XSLT to turn raw exam result data into a clean, readable HTML page. I used XSLT to pull 
                                        in details like reference numbers, scores, and digital signatures, and display them in a structured table format. It was a 
                                        simple but useful exercise that helped me better understand how XML works with styling tools like XSLT to present data clearly 
                                        in the browser.

                                        This was a fun project where I created an interactive tool that lets users input the coordinates of a triangle’s vertices and 
                                        see it drawn live on a canvas. Using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas element, the program not only draws the triangle but 
                                        also highlights its medians and labels each vertex.

                                        This mini project includes two interactive tools built with HTML and JavaScript. The first takes user input for a subject (like 
                                        code, title, credit points, and core subject status) and turns it into a formatted JSON string. The second does the reverse. It 
                                        reads a JSON object and fills out the form with the relevant details.

                                        This is an Android app built to connect pet owners with trusted sitters, making it easier to 
                                        schedule, review, and manage pet care services. I was part of a six-member team, though one member 
                                        had to drop out midway through the project. I initially shared responsibility for the UI/UX 
                                        design, but due to some circumstances, I had to take on the full design workload creating 
                                        wireframes in Canva and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma. In addition to design, I also worked on 
                                        the frontend development, building core user interfaces using React Native. I also contributed to 
                                        the documentation of the project. This project taught me how to adapt quickly, take initiative, 
                                        and apply both design thinking and technical skills to build a functional application.

                                        This is an Android app I built where users can animate a cat image by tapping buttons. The cat can spin, fade, scale down, or 
                                        move across the screen each effect triggered by a different button. I used a mix of XML-based animations and Java code with 
                                        ObjectAnimator to bring the interactions to life. It was a fun way to get more comfortable with Android UI elements, layout 
                                        handling, and animation tools.

                                        This is a simple but fully functional Android stopwatch using Java and Android Studio. The app lets users start, stop, and reset

                                        lifecycles, button clicks, and updating the UI as the app runs. Even though the app is simple, building it helped me gain 
                                        confidence working in Android Studio and writing clean, functional code.

                                        This was one of my most comprehensive projects. My team and I designed a 
                                        complete IT infrastructure upgrade for a growing medical clinic and presented our 
                                        proposed solution to the client. I was responsible for designing the clinical staff’s 
                                        side of the system using the high-level specifications provided by the clinic’s owner 
                                        to anticipate the staff's needs. I also ensured that the design indicated that the 
                                        system was fully integrated with all other components, including the patient portal, 
                                        accounting system, cybersecurity measures, database structure, networking 
                                        infrastructure, and IT support ticketing system, as this was a main problem for the 
                                        clinic. I also individually wrote a business proposal presenting our solution to the 
                                        client. This project taught me how to think from a user’s perspective even with limited 
                                        information, and how to align subsystem design with broader infrastructure, security, 
                                        and support requirements.

                                    <h4>Business Flow Microservices System</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        As part of a three-member team, I worked on a prototype e-commerce web application using microservices and Domain-Driven Design. 
                                        While I was initially responsible for the Sales context, I also stepped in to resolve integration issues in the Procurement and 
                                        Customer Account services. When a teammate faced persistent environment issues with the Analytics microservice, I took over and 
                                        rebuilt it from scratch, including its event-driven stream processing. I also documented the final report, covering the system 
                                        design and service interactions. This project sharpened my backend skills and taught me to adapt quickly, support my team, and 
                                        deliver under pressure.

                                        In this team project, My team built a web application for managing research paper 
                                        submissions, peer reviews, and conference workflows. I was responsible for designing 
                                        the system admin's interface and contributing to the backend using Java, Spring Boot, 
                                        and MongoDB. My responsibilities also included writing the functional and 
                                        non-functional requirements, creating and describing the state, sequence, and use case 
                                        diagrams, documenting design patterns and engineering principles, and developing OCL 
                                        rules for data logic. This project gave me the chance to approach a system from both a 
                                        developer’s and a designer’s perspective as I had to constantly switch between user 
                                        needs and technical requirements. The project tested my ability to explain every 
                                        decision we took clearly. It also pushed me to collaborate across different parts of 
                                        the project, and step in to support the team wherever needed.
