            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    I am a recent Computer Science (Honours) graduate from the University of Wollongong and an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in R, 
                    Python, SQL, NoSQL, machine learning, and data visualization. My portfolio reflects not only my passion for working with data, but also my broader 
                    experience in software development, UI/UX design, and business-focused IT solutions. These diverse experiences have helped me become a well-rounded 
                    problem-solver who can approach challenges from both analytical and user-centric perspectives. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy uncovering insights from data and transforming them into meaningful, actionable outcomes. Whether I am building models, designing dashboards, 
                    or exploring new datasets, I thrive on turning complexity into clarity. I am continually expanding my skill set and excited to apply data-driven 
                    thinking to real-world problems across industries.

                                    <h4>Bear Hunt Strategy Optimization – Whiteout Survival</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This ongoing project aims to optimize performance in the Bear Hunt event from the mobile game Whiteout Survival. Since the game 
                                        does not offer a public API, I am currently in the data collection stage, manually logging rallies, troop deployments, and 
                                        milestone progress. The project focuses on identifying which rally types offer the best reward-to-effort ratio, developing a 
                                        strategy to assign troops across seven deployments for maximum damage, and predicting when all milestones will be achieved. I 
                                        also plan to build a performance dashboard to visualize damage by deployment, rally effectiveness, and milestone progress over 
                                        time. Additionally, I will explore damage forecasting using time series or regression models to support more strategic 
                                        decision-making during the event.

                                    <p>
                                        A big data analysis project comparing model performance across ImageNet and ImageNetV2. As project manager of a three-member 
                                        team, I coordinated roles, set deadlines, and facilitated meetings. This was my first time working with such a large dataset.
                                        The code took a significant amount of time to run due to its size, which taught me the importance of optimizing for scale. I 
                                        handled hyperparameter tuning, trained, tested, and evaluated the tuned model, created visualizations to compare performance 
                                        before and after tuning, and conducted KS hypothesis testing. I also documented and analysed the results.

                                        I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis, and applied TF-IDF and sentiment analysis to uncover 
                                        linguistic and emotional patterns. I then visualized, documented, and analyzed the results to highlight differences between human

                                    <p>
                                        This was my very first data analysis group project and also my first time learning R. I chose to take this subject and take on the 
                                        challenge knowing I would be working with students who already had experience in both areas. I had to learn quickly, and while it 
                                        was challenging at times, it pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow. In our team of four, I took the lead on data 
                                        preprocessing, EDA, and visualizations. I also built and evaluated a Random Forest model, and documented our findings in a final 
                                        presentation. The project was a rewarding learning experience that strengthened both my technical and collaborative skills. It 
                                        was also what made me interested in data analysis.

                                        I worked on this project alongside the “Bank Marketing – Term Deposit Prediction” task. The goal was to predict customer 
                                        creditworthiness using 46 financial and demographic attributes. After exploring the dataset through statistical analysis and SOMs, 
                                        I implemented and compared several models including MLP, Decision Tree, Random Forest (manual tuning), SVM (auto-tuning), Naive 
                                        Bayes, and Logistic Regression. I applied feature selection, evaluated models using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and ROC 
                                        curves, and predicted the credit rating of a median customer. This project strengthened my skills in R and machine learning, 
                                        especially in handling imbalanced, real-world data.

                                        initially responsible for building some of the K-means clustering models, but due to a teammate’s unexpected situation, I took on 
                                        the full responsibility of developing all clustering models. These included customer segmentation, product popularity analysis, 
                                        and geographic purchase behavior. I also documented and interpreted the results of my models, highlighting insights and future 
                                        strategies that could support loyalty programs and sales strategies. This project helped me quickly adapt to a new tool while 
                                        learning how to take ownership and communicate data-driven findings clearly.

                                    <p>
                                        As part of a three-member team, I worked on a prototype e-commerce web application using microservices and Domain-Driven Design. 
                                        While I was initially responsible for the Sales context, I also stepped in to resolve integration issues in the Procurement and 
                                        Customer Account services. When a teammate faced persistent environment issues with the Analytics microservice, I took over and 
                                        rebuilt it from scratch, including its event-driven stream processing. I also documented the final report, covering the system 
                                        design and service interactions. This project sharpened my backend skills and taught me to adapt quickly, support my team, and 
                                        deliver under pressure.

                                    <p>
                                        This project was one of the largest and most detailed I've worked on, involving the creation of a realistic election campaign 
                                        simulator in C++. The simulator models political parties, candidates, leaders, and electorates, each holding unique stances on 
                                        key national issues. Each simulated campaign day, random events, such as candidate debates, affected voter opinions, shifting the 
                                        party popularity. To determine election outcomes, the program considered candidates' characteristics, voter demographics, and 
                                        party positions on major issues. Developing this project involved managing over 20 interconnected files and designing an extensive 
                                        class hierarchy, greatly enhancing my skills in object-oriented design, event-driven logic, and complex system architecture.

                                    <p>
                                        This was a hands-on project where I built a Java-based system to simulate ordering custom PC parts. The program allows users to 
                                        select compatible components, such as CPUs, motherboards, memory, and graphics cards, while handling brand-specific rules for 
                                        Intel and AMD. It also supports both member and non-member customers, with automatic discount application. I structured the system 
                                        using object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism to keep the design clean and modular. This project helped me 
                                        deepen my understanding of OOP and apply it to a realistic, logic-driven ordering scenario.

                                        This was one of the first large-scale projects where I applied object-oriented programming to build a full student management 
                                        system in Java. It models real-world academic processes like course enrollment, tracking student records, and managing both 
                                        undergraduate and postgraduate students. I designed and connected multiple classes, such as Student, Subject, Course, and 
                                        Enrollment, to reflect how an actual university system might work. Working on this project really helped me understand how to 
                                        structure code clearly and design systems that are easy to extend and maintain.

                                        In this Java project, I built a simulation that models how customers interact with bank tellers, helping to understand queue 
                                        dynamics and service efficiency. Using object-oriented programming, I created classes to represent customers and tellers, and 
                                        implemented a priority queue to manage service order realistically. Customer data, including arrival and service times, was 
                                        loaded from a file, making the simulation reflect real-life situations. This project gave me practical experience with managing 
                                        data structures, writing event-driven logic, and designing clear, organized code to tackle everyday problems.

                                        In this project, I built a Java application that calculates optimal paths through a weighted graph, reading data directly from 
                                        structured text files. I developed a custom min-heap structure for efficient pathfinding and designed classes like Vertex and 
                                        Path to represent the graph clearly and effectively. This work deepened my understanding of data structures, algorithm 
                                        optimization, and practical application of graph theory to solve realistic routing problems.
